			<h3>History of Vishranthi Church</h3>
			<p>
				The history of Vishranthi Church can be traced back from the year
				1806 to 1816, birth of an era of Peace Revolution in the place
				called Basel in the country of Switzerland. In the year 1815 Rev.
				Blumhardt of South Germany, Rev. M. Flone Basel of Wittenberg and
				another member of Chief Institution from Basel started an
				Organisation called "BASEL MISSION" Institution. On 26* of August
				1816, three Missionaries were sent from Basel to different countries
				for the purpose of Ministerial work, the first Missionaries were
				sent to South Africa. In the year 1812, the British Government who
				were was ruling India gave permission to Basel Mission Institution
				to spread the Gospel in the West Coast of India from Cochin to
				Mumbai.
			</p>
			<p>
				With this opportunity Basel Mission organization sent three
				Missionaries to India in the year 1834. The first Basel Missionaries
				who arrived in the Western Coast of India were John Christopher
				Lenher, Christoph Leoward Grener and Samuel Hebich. These three
				Missionaries arrived in Calicut on 14th of October 1834 and traveled
				towards Mangalore by sea and arrived in the Port of Bockapatna on
				30th October 1834. They were welcomed by the Dakshina Kannada
				Collector Mr. Findel Anderson and Assistant Collector Mr. Fudeeron.
				They not only welcomed the Missionaries but also gave them all the
				support they needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				These people took a rented house from one Parsi brother in the place
				called Neereshwalya village now called the Mission Street' and this
				place was thus the beginning of these 3 Missionaries and the
				beginning of the Missionary Work in India. As a result of their work
				in Mangalore the number of christians believer started increasing.
				For the livelihood of these Christians a Tile Factory was
				established in the year 1865 by the Missionaries at Jeppu. Since,
				there was a growing demand for Tiles and the sales of the Tiles
				multiplied the Missionaries selected a place at Kudroli and started
				a new tile factory in the year 1882 and the work started in the year
				1883.
			</p>
			<p>
				They felt that a need of place for worship for Christians was
				necessary for the workers who were working in the Tile factory,
				because at that time they found it difficult to go to Balmatta and
				Jeppu to worship at this time the number of Christians was 1967. The
				Missionaries had made a separate room for worship in the factory
				itself. To look after the congregation in Mangalore Rev. Samuel
				Andrew and Rev. A Menner were appointed and at the same time a
				Missionary Official declared Kudroli as a local congregation in the
				year 1886.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore even though the origin of the congregation was 1883, the
				foundation stone for church building was laid on 27th of July 1887.
				Since they had the plan to complete the church construction work
				before the rainy season, the building was completed and the
				dedication of the church was held on 20th May 1888 in the place
				where we find the church now. In the beginning of the church history
				entire village was hit by an epidemic disease called "Sidubu" (Small
				fox), fortunately only 7 people died out of this epidemic from this
				church.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, when we keenly observe the activities in the Christian
				church we get to know that the Holy Spirit was very actively working
				amongst the Christian families, when it was dawn there was family
				prayer in each and every house and the hymns could be heard which a
				unique witness of godliness amoung christian.
			</p>
			<p>
				In those days if there was any dispute among the Christians, they
				would withdraw from attending the church worship on Sundays until
				the settlement of such disputes take place. They would spend their
				time in the presence of God in meditation for their iniquity. As the
				congregation was increasing in number entire congregation was
				involved in the service of the Lord. Youngsters used to spend time
				in the service of the Lord. In the year 1896 Young Men's Prayer
				Union (YMPU) was started and YMCA used to help them. School and
				Balavadi started for the education of children.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirdly, a Bell Tower was constructed in order to beautify the
				Church, the entire sponsorship was done by a Chief Officer of the
				tile factory Mr. Brashaidhar. On 8th September 1946 Pulpit and
				Vestry was added to the Church. Electrification to the Church was
				done under the leadership of Rev. Lucas L. J. Samartha who was the
				Presbyter of the Church.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the year 1963 it was decided to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of
				the church under the leadership of Rev. J.E. Jathanna as a
				renovation of the church balcony was constructed under the
				sponsorship of Mr. Theodore Soans, Mr. Prabhakar Tholar and Mr.
				Solomon Samuel Soans, the Proprietors of Tile Factory, Kundapur.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the year 1986 Mr. A. S. Anchan donated Rs. 30,000/- towards the
				renovation of Bell Tower. As result at the Bell Tower got a new
				artistick look.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the 1st World War in the year 1938 the British Government
				took over the Missionary Industrial Units and transfeed to the
				Common Wealth Trust. Due to this factor many Christian houses at
				Kudroli were taken over by them. But the Missionary Officers i.e.
				Rev. Dr. P.E. Burkart and Rev. Strikeeron collected back those
				houses and property from the British Government and gave it back to
				for christians. At this juncture we need to remember with gratitude
				the service of these Missionary Officers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Vishranthi Church joined with other churches in witnessing in the
				field of Industry, Education Healthcare and Literature in order to
				spread the love of Christ to others.
